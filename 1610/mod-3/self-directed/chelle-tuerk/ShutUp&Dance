ShutUp&Dance

I am building a small-scale version music app that provides the user with options to find a local venue where a 
particular artist is going to play at.

Reflection

I'm very interested in landing an internship with Pandora or Spotify...aim high, riiiiight??  I thought it would behoove me to 
be able to present a project thatk was up their alley.  I have a number of contacts on LinkedIn that work at both companies.

What did you set out to build?
A monster.  I set out to build a monster.  Realistically, the MVP will be pulling in audio from Spotify's API, authorizing a user,
authorizing a user's playlist, and mayyyybe looking up venues where sought out artist will be performing..still waiting to 
hear back from ReverbNation to access their internal API.

Why was this project challenging and therefore a really good learning experience?
Yes.  Absolutely.  I'm pretty sure I'm way in over my head, tho.

What were some unexpected obstacles?
Yes.  Many.  The beackend is a beast.  I'm slowlyyy making progress.

What tools did you use to implement this project?
I using spotify API, potentially ReverbNation's API, potentially GoogleMaps API, express node for the backend.  React Router and
React-Redux for the front end, and SASS for styling.
